        <h2>Project Transparency</h2>
        <p>2% of the previous day's Auction will continue to be invested back into the current day's auction every single day.</p>
        <p>There is a ONE DAY lock on share earning on stakes. This means your first day of a stake will not generate dividends from the auction.</p>
        <p>Lastly, there is a penalty for unstaking early. This is to hopefully mitigate so-called "suicide staking". You will gain all earned TRX shares, but you will lose some BUB Tokens based on how much time is left on the stake if you unstake early.</p>
